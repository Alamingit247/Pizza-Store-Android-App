# Pizza Store App

Welcome to the **Pizza Store** app, a simple Android application where users can order pizzas, receive notifications, and track their order time with a countdown timer. The app is built using Kotlin and follows modern Android development practices.

## Features

- **Select Pizza Type and Size:** Users can choose the type and size of their pizza using dropdown menus.
- **Order Confirmation:** Once an order is placed, users receive a confirmation and can see the order details.
- **Countdown Timer:** A countdown timer starts from 30 minutes, showing how much time is left until the pizza is ready.
- **Notifications:** 
  - Users receive a notification when they place an order.
  - A second notification is sent when the pizza is ready, accompanied by sound and vibration.
- **Modify Order:** The app allows users to go back and modify their order before it's confirmed.
